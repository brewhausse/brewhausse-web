    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
        I knew I wanted to take advantage of my one chance to see a solar eclipse so I started researching how best to view one safely.
        I came accross several homemade diy solar telescopes that people were putting together. The advantage to having such
        a telescope is that you don't have to look directly at the sun, which just seems like a completely bad idea. Not
        to mention the image can be magnified for easy viewing. One other concern for me, is that I have a two year old daughter
        and I really didn't want to be encouraging her to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other thing I wanted to do was to try and record the eclipse in some way. I had recently purchased a Raspberry Pi3 and
        knew I wanted to put together a timelapse camera. So I decided to pull the trigger and purchase a pi camera and marry
        the two projects together to create a timelapse of the eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I had a series of images from the timelapse, I would turn it into a video using <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>.
        But my main objective was to make sure I could be taking pictures by the time the eclipse rolled around.
    </p>
    <h4>Building the Solar Projector</h4>
    <div class="project-image seven columns u-pull-right">
        <img class="u-max-full-width" src="/images/solar.projector.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>
        I basically followed these instructions for putting together the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neilzim.net/sunprojector/">solar projector</a>.
        All the credit for this goes to Neil Zimmerman and Michael Hepler. The article has a lot of great info on the concept
        behind solar projectors along with some nice diagrams. I'll leave it to you to go check it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        The parts list is pretty simple.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            27-mm diameter, 285 mm focal length lens
        </li>
        <li>
            1.25" diameter, 12.5 mm focal length eyepiece
        </li>
        <li>
            90&deg; star diagonal that would fit 1.25" tubing
        </li>
        <li>
            Telescoping tubing
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tube #1 - 1 1/2" diameter tubing, I used some scrap pvc pipe
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tube #2 - toilet paper tube
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 1/4" x 1" PVC pipe bushing (see instructions on Neil's site)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Projection Housing
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I used some large cardboard boxes I had laying around both for the body and base of the telescope.
                </li>
                <li>
                    White printer paper for image canvas.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> After putting the telescope together, I struggled to get it focused. I ended up waiting for a clear night so I could
        go outside and look through it at the moon. Once I could see the moon, I changed to length of the telescope by sliding
        the toilet paper tube up and down the pvc tubing. This shortening and lengthening of the focal length allowed me
        to dial in the image focus. It took a few tries as I was way off on my tube lengths and kept having to shave off
        more of the pvc tubing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I got the telescope focused, I taped the toilet paper tube to the pvc tubing so that the tubes would stay in place and
        wouldn't lose focus. I then took a cardboard box and cut a hole in the top of the box, about three quarters from
        the top for the eyepiece to poke through and placed the eyepiece of the telescope in the hole and taped it up so
        it wouldn't move.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next I made a square cut on the side of the box for viewing the projected image and taped some printer paper to the inside
        of the box, opposite the eyepiece. For the base of the telescope, I used another cardboard box. I cut out two large
        round cardboard circles that I then glued to the body of the cardboard box holding the telescope so that I could
        set the body of the telescope into the base on it's round wheels. This allowed the telescope to move up and down,
        and the base could be turned left and right for tracking the suns path across the sky at pretty much any angle.
    </p>
    <h4>Raspicam Timelapse</h4>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, when I ordered the pi camera, I ended up ordering the NoIR (non filtering infrared) version, which is essentially
        a night camera meant to be used with infrared lights. You can still take pictures during the day with this camera,
        but it has the effect of turning everything pink and red. I figured it would be fine for my eclipse project since
        there wasn't really any color contrast to the projected image of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple of shell commands that can be used to take video or still images with the pi camera. There are several
        flags that can be passed to determine image quality and orientation.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md">raspistill</a> - captures
            still photographs
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspivid.md">raspivid</a> - captures
            video
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once I got the hang of taking pictures and messing with the various options, I decided it would be nice if I could set a
        date and time for a timelapse to occur and just walk away. Something like a scheduled task. Not being much of a Linux
        guru, I figured I would stick to Node.js and use a timer to trigger the timelapse. I don't really think this is the
        best solution, but it would get the job done.
    </p>
    <p> So I decided to check out some pi camera Node.js modules and found that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/raspicam">raspicam</a>        
        was an npm package that wrapped the raspistill commands and even had a timelapse option. The only thing I needed
        to figure out was when to start the timelapse.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make sure I understood some of the variables and settings that needed to go into the timelapse, I searched around and
        found this really helpful <a href="http://www.photopills.com/calculators/timelapse">timelapse calculator</a>.
        Depending on your constrained objective, you need to setup a few parameters.  The calculator basically allows you to
        pick the variable you want it to calculate, namely the shooting interval, clip length or event duration.  The shooting interval
        is the time between pictures.  The clip length is the length of video you are trying to create.  And the event duration is essentially
        the length of time that the timelapse will occur.  There is some art to setting up the parameters depending on the event you're
        trying to capture.  For instance, if you are trying to capture a sunrise, you might have a longer time interval between pictures than
        you would if you were trying to get a timelapse of a crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I had some idea of the parameters, I decided to setup a timelapse.js app that would pull from a couple of config files and 
        setup the timelapse. Below is a sample of the config file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>var config = {
        mode: Enums.CalcMode.VideoLength,
        start: moment('2017-08-17 13:00:00'),
        eventDurationSec: moment.duration(3, 'hours').asSeconds(),
        video: {
          fps: 25
        },
        shootingIntervalSec: 5
      };</code></pre>

    <h6>Settings Explained</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><bold>Mode</bold> - Determines what variable we want to calculate. Possible values are:
            <ul>
                <li>Video Length (sec)</li>
                <li>Shooting Interval (sec)</li>
                <li>Event Duration (sec)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Start - The date and time the camera will start taking pictures.</li>
        <li>Event Duration - How long the the camera will take pictures.</li>
        <li>Video - All video specific settings will be contained inside it's own object.
            <ul>
                <li>fps - The target rate of frames per second for the video.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shooting Interval - The number of seconds between pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once run, the user is prompted with any missing parameters.  If everything is ok, then they are prompted with the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        Calculating:                           VideoLength
        Start:                     August 17, 2017 1:00 PM
        Event Duration:                       3 hrs, 0 min
        Shooting Interval:                    0 min, 5 sec
        Video Length:                        1 min, 26 sec
        Video Fps:                                      25
        Number of Photos:                             2160
        
        Continue? [Y/n]</code></pre>
    <p>
        If user continues, a timeout is set and the calculated number of seconds to wait before executing the startTimelapse is passed in.
    </p>
    <p>
        (I have since done some research and found that there are a number of npm packages that will take care of scheduling the timelapse. I plan on 
        converting to one of those methods in the future.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the timelapse starts, the pictures are stored in a folder and named photo_1.jpg, photo_2.jpg, photo_3.jpg, etc.  The name
        of the images are set by passing an options object to the RaspiCam module with a special pattern.  My setting look like this:    
    </p>
    <pre><code>var opts = {
            mode: 'timelapse',
            output: 'photos/photo_%d.jpg',
            hflip: true,
            vflip: true,
            timelapse: 5,
            nopreview: true,
            encoding: 'jpg',
            quality: 75,
            timeout: 0
          }
        </code></pre>
