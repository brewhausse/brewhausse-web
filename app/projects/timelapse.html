    <!-- <p>
        While reading up on some of the best options for viewing a solar eclipse, I came
        accross a great site describing how to build your own <a href="http://www.neilzim.net/sunprojector/">solar projection telescope</a>.
        by Neil T. Zimmerman and Michael Helper. It included instructions and a parts
        list with links to purchase the parts.  All in all, I spent less thirty-five dollars.        
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided soon after that i should try and get a timelapse of the eclipse.  To do this
        I bought a raspi-cam for my Raspberry Pi 3.  For some reason, I bought the NoIR version
        which is more for night viewing and meant to be used with infared light.  I wasn't paying
        attention.
